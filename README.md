# Milwaukee_Bitcoin_Meetup

The Milwaukee Bitcoin Meetup convenes every month, drawing those intrigued by the possibilities of Bitcoin: A Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. More than just financial rebelling, our group explores the broader social impacts of this sly roundabout cryptographic system.

Join lively discussions around empowering individuals through technology. Share your perspectives on reducing institutional oversight in favor of voluntary peer-to-peer organization. Or just gather with open-minded people interested in the promise of increased privacy and anonymity online.

Meetup over drinks as we discuss the current landscape and future trajectory of digital payments, online communities, and personal liberties. All curious, innovative thinkers are welcome.

Beware of scammers and forks - This meetup is an independent event and is not affiliated with any other meetups using similar names. We want to make it clear that our group operates independently, and any attempts by other groups to falsely associate with us are categorically denied. Participants should be aware that this meetup is a distinct entity and is not associated with any other groups or organizations.

If this is your first time at one of our meetups, we have a few simple guidelines to enhance everyone’s experience:
------
- Our meetups and events have a simple and singular focus: Bitcoin. All of our topics and discussions will be centered around Bitcoin, the global monetary network, and bitcoin, the reserve asset. If you are interested in crypto tokens, stocks, blockchains, altcoins, alternative investing, NFTs, etc. that is completely fine. There are a number of other meetups to join. This meetup however is just focused on Bitcoin

- Please *no photos* unless everyone agrees and there are not any other folks in the background. We respect everyone’s privacy and want everyone to feel comfortable as they participate

- Chatham House Rules are a set of confidentiality guidelines used to facilitate open and honest discussions while preserving anonymity. Under these rules, participants are free to express their views during a meeting or discussion without revealing the identity or affiliation of the speaker or any other participant. The key principle is that information shared within the session can be used, but the source remains anonymous. This allows for more candid and open conversations, fostering a safe space for sharing diverse perspectives without the fear of personal attribution outside the session.

What is a Socratic Seminar?
------
Socratic seminars embody the essence of the Socratic method, which hinges on the belief that questioning is fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge. These structured discussions prioritize inquiry-driven dialogue, emphasizing exploration and collaborative examination of ideas rather than adversarial argumentation. In these seminars, participants collectively engage in vocal contemplation, embracing the interactive process of co-constructing profound insights that surpass what any individual could achieve alone. This method highlights the communal aspect of knowledge creation, fostering a deeper, more meaningful understanding through shared exploration and dialogue.
